    <h2>What is Lung Cancer?</h2>
    <p> <a href="types.html"><strong>Types of Cancer</strong></a></p>
     <p><a href="signs.html"><strong>Signs and Symptoms</strong></a></p>
     
    <p>Lung cancer is a disease caused by uncontrolled cell division in your lungs. Your cells divide and make more copies of themselves as a part of their normal function. But sometimes, they get changes (mutations) that cause them to keep making more of themselves when they shouldn’t. Damaged cells dividing uncontrollably create masses, or tumors, of tissue that eventually keep your organs from working properly.</p>
    <p>Lung cancer is the name for cancers that start in your lungs — usually in the airways (bronchi or bronchioles) or small air sacs (alveoli). Cancers that start in other places and move to your lungs are usually named for where they start (your healthcare provider may refer to this as cancer that’s metastatic to your lungs).</p>
    
     <h2>Types of Lung Cancer</h2>
    <ul>
        
        <h3><li>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)</li></h3>
         <p>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. It accounts for over 80% of lung cancer cases. Common types include adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Adenosquamous carcinoma and sarcomatoid carcinoma are two less common types of NSCLC.</p>     
         <h3><li>Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)</li></h3>
        Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) grows more quickly and is harder to treat than NSCLC. It’s often found as a relatively small lung tumor that’s already spread to other parts of your body. Specific types of SCLC include small cell carcinoma (also called oat cell carcinoma) and combined small cell carcinoma.
        
         <h3><li>Lymphoma</li></h3>
          <p>Lymphoma is cancer that begins in lymphocytes (T cells or B cells). These are disease-fighting white blood cells that are part of the immune system. In lymphoma, abnormal lymphocytes build up in lymph nodes and lymph vessels, as well as in other organs of the body.</p>
          <p>There are two main types of lymphoma:</p>
          <p>Hodgkin lymphoma – People with this disease have abnormal lymphocytes that are called Reed-Sternberg cells. These cells usually form from B cells.</p>
          <p>Non-Hodgkin lymphoma – This is a large group of cancers that start in lymphocytes. The cancers can grow quickly or slowly and can form from B cells or T cells.</p>   
        
         <h3><li>Multiple Myeloma</li></h3>
         <p>Multiple myeloma is cancer that begins in plasma cells, another type of immune cell. The abnormal plasma cells, called myeloma cells, build up in the bone marrow and form tumors in bones all through the body. Multiple myeloma is also called plasma cell myeloma and Kahler disease.</p>
       
        <h3><li>Melanoma</li></h3>
        <p>Melanoma is cancer that begins in cells that become melanocytes, which are specialized cells that make melanin (the pigment that gives skin its color). Most melanomas form on the skin, but melanomas can also form in other pigmented tissues, such as the eye.</p> 
    </ul>



    <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    <p>Common symptoms include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Pain</li>
        <li>Skin changes</li>
        <li>Fatigue or extreme tiredness that doesn’t get better with rest.</li>
         <li>Weight loss or gain of 10 pounds or more for no known reason</li>
        <li>Eating problems such as not feeling hungry, trouble swallowing, belly pain, or nausea and vomiting</li>
       <li>Swelling or lumps anywhere in the body</li>
         <li>Thickening or lump in the breast or other part of the body</li>
        <li>Pain, especially new or with no known reason, that doesn’t go away or gets worse</li>
        <li>Skin changes such as a lump that bleeds or turns scaly, a new mole or a change in a mole, a sore that does not heal, or a yellowish color to the skin or eyes (jaundice).</li>
           <li>Cough or hoarseness that does not go away</li>
          <li>Unusual bleeding or bruising for no known reason</li>
           <li>Change in bowel habits, such as constipation or diarrhea, that doesn’t go away or a change in how your stools looks </li>
        <li>Bladder changes such as pain when passing urine, blood in the urine or needing to pass urine more or less often</li>
       <li>Fever or nights sweats</li>
        <li>Headaches</li>
        <li>Vision or hearing problems</li>
            <li>Mouth changes such as sores, bleeding, pain, or numbness</li>

    </ul>


    <h2>Prevention</h2>
    <p>How can I reduce my risk of developing lymphoma?</p>
    <ul>
       <li>Researchers continue to identify lymphoma risk factors. There’s reason to believe certain viruses and family medical history increase the risk of developing lymphoma. Talk to your healthcare provider if you think your medical history or family medical history might increase your risk of developing lymphoma.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Get Involved</h2>
    <p>Join the fight against cancer by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Donating to cancer research organizations</li>
        <li>Participating in awareness events</li>
        <li>Spreading the word</li>
    </ul>
